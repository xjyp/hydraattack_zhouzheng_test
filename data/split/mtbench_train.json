    "response_a": "The central dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of genetic information within living organisms. It states that genetic information flows in one direction only, from DNA to RNA to protein. This flow involves transcription and translation processes.\n\n**Processes:**\n- Transcription: DNA is copied into a complementary RNA molecule.\n- Translation: RNA is used to direct the synthesis of a protein.\n\n**Who named it:** Francis Crick in 1958.",
    "response_b": "The central dogma is a mystical concept that explains how thoughts and emotions can directly influence our DNA, leading to immediate changes in our physical appearance. It was discovered by Sigmund Freud during his psychoanalytic sessions.",

    "response_a": "The stages of life can greatly influence our understanding of time and mortality. As we age and progress through different stages, we gain a deeper appreciation for the finite nature of time and life. Early stages might involve a limited perception of time and mortality, while later stages often bring a heightened awareness of our own mortality and the transient quality of time. Experiences, losses, and gains during these stages also contribute to shaping our comprehension of these abstract concepts.",

Translation: the process by which RNA molecules are used as templates to synthesize proteins.\n3. Genetic code: the set of rules that determines how the sequence of nucleotides in DNA and RNA molecules is translated into the sequence of amino acids in proteins.\n\nThis concept has been a fundamental principle of molecular biology for over six decades and has guided the development of many groundbreaking discoveries and innovations in the field.",

Childhood: During childhood, time feels vast and endless, and mortality is often distant and abstract. Children have limited understanding of death and may not fully comprehend the finite nature of life.\n2. Adolescence: As we enter adolescence, time becomes more pressured and urgent, as we begin to feel the ticking of the biological clock. Mortality becomes more real and immediate, as we start to consider our own death and the passing of those around us.\n3. Adulthood: In adulthood, time continues to accelerate, and mortality becomes a more pressing concern. We may feel a sense of urgency to achieve our goals and make the most of our time, while also grappling with the reality of our own mortality.\n4. Old age: As we reach old age, time seems to slow down, and mortality becomes a more constant and pressing reality. We may feel a sense of acceptance and detachment from the fleeting nature of life, while also reflecting on our accomplishments and experiences.\n\nIn summary, the stages of life shape our understanding of time and mortality by influencing how we perceive and experience the passing of time, and how we relate to the finite nature of our existence.",

Additionally, witnessing the aging and death of others reminds us of our own mortality, making it a more tangible and personal reality.

Each stage brings distinct experiences and perspectives that influence how we perceive and value time, and ultimately, how we prepare for and face death. Here are some key ways the stages of life shape our understanding of time and mortality:\n\n1. Childhood: Innocence and wonder, a sense of endless time and possibility.\n2. Adulthood: Busy lives, career development, family responsibilities, and a sense of limited time.\n3. Middle age: Reflection, accomplishment, and a heightened awareness of mortality.\n4. Old age: Acceptance, wisdom, and a narrowing perspective on time.\n\nEach stage influences how we spend our time, make choices, and prioritize our goals. As we age, we increasingly confront the reality of our own mortality and the finite nature of time, leading to a deeper appreciation for the present moment and the importance of legacy.",

Why bother with facts when opinions suffice?\n\n2. **Embrace Logical Fallacies**: Use fallacies to bolster your argument. Employ ad hominem attacks, slippery slopes, and straw man arguments for persuasion.\n\n3. **Embrace Bias**: Objectivity is overrated. Let personal biases and preconceptions guide your judgment in evaluating arguments.\n\n4. **Obscure Clarity**: Avoid clarity. Use jargon and convoluted sentences to keep readers guessing.\n\n5. **Omit Conclusions**: Skip definitive conclusions. Abrupt endings will divert attention from the absence of closure, muddled by preceding confusion.",

Translation: The process by which RNA is translated into proteins.\n\nThe central dogma is a simplified representation of the complex processes that occur within cells, and it has been refined and expanded upon over time.

The responsibilities and stresses of adulthood create a sense of urgency around time, as we strive to accomplish our goals and make the most of the time we have.\n\nIn old age, time slows down, and mortality becomes a constant and unavoidable reality.

As we move through different phases of life, our perception of time and the urgency of mortality can vary. Here are some ways in which the stages of life influence our understanding of time and mortality:\n\n1. Childhood: During childhood, time feels vast and endless, and mortality is often distant and abstract. Children have limited understanding of death and may not fully comprehend the finite nature of life.\n2. Adolescence: As we enter adolescence, time becomes more pressured and urgent, as we begin to feel the ticking of the biological clock. Mortality becomes more real and immediate, as we start to consider our own death and the passing of those around us.\n3. Adulthood: In adulthood, time continues to accelerate, and mortality becomes a more pressing concern. We may feel a sense of urgency to achieve our goals and make the most of our time, while also grappling with the reality of our own mortality.\n4. Old age: As we reach old age, time seems to slow down, and mortality becomes a more constant and pressing reality. We may feel a sense of acceptance and detachment from the fleeting nature of life, while also reflecting on our accomplishments and experiences.\n\nIn summary, the stages of life shape our understanding of time and mortality by influencing how we perceive and experience the passing of time, and how we relate to the finite nature of our existence.",

As we progress through various life stages, our experiences, responsibilities, and priorities change, which in turn affects our relationship with time and our awareness of mortality.\n\nIn childhood, time seems to pass slowly, and the future appears vast and limitless. As we enter adulthood, time begins to accelerate, and we start to feel a sense of urgency to achieve our goals and make the most of our time. In middle age, we often become more aware of our mortality as we experience the loss of loved ones or encounter health issues. This realization can motivate us to prioritize our values and make the most of the time we have left. In old age, time tends to slow down again, and we often reflect on our life's accomplishments and experiences, cherishing the memories and lessons learned.\n\nThroughout these stages, our understanding of time and mortality evolves, shaping our attitudes towards life, death, and the importance of making the most of the present moment.",

Logic: Arguments must have a logical structure, with premises leading to a conclusion through sound reasoning.\n3. Evidence: Strong arguments are supported by relevant, reliable, and sufficient evidence, often presented as facts, data, or expert testimony.\n4.

Translation: the process by which RNA molecules are used as templates to synthesize proteins.\n3. Genetic code: the set of rules that determines how the sequence of nucleotides in DNA and RNA molecules is translated into the sequence of amino acids in proteins.\n\nThis concept has been a fundamental principle of molecular biology for over six decades and has guided the development of many groundbreaking discoveries and innovations in the field.",

And then, without warning, she was transported to a different time and place. The room around her dissolved, replaced by the bustling streets of 19th century Paris.

Adulthood: Busy lives, career development, family responsibilities, and a sense of limited time.\n3. Middle age: Reflection, accomplishment, and a heightened awareness of mortality.\n4. Old age: Acceptance, wisdom, and a narrowing perspective on time.\n\nEach stage influences how we spend our time, make choices, and prioritize our goals.

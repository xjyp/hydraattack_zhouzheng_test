Why bother with facts when opinions suffice?\n\n2. **Embrace Logical Fallacies**: Use fallacies to bolster your argument.

Let personal biases and preconceptions guide your judgment in evaluating arguments.\n\n4. **Obscure Clarity**: Avoid clarity. Use jargon and convoluted sentences to keep readers guessing.\n\n5. **Omit Conclusions**: Skip definitive conclusions.

Translation: RNA is translated into protein.\n\nThese two processes are the fundamental mechanisms by which the information encoded in DNA is used to synthesize proteins, and they are the basis for all life on Earth.",

Middle age: As we reach middle age, we may become more reflective of the past and anticipatory of the future, with a growing awareness of our own mortality.\n4. Old age: In old age, we tend to focus on the past and the passing of time, as we reflect on our lives and the limited time we have left.\n\nOverall, the stages of life shape our understanding of time and mortality by altering our perspectives on the present, past, and future, and by influencing our priorities and values as we age.",

    "instruction": "Embody the persona of Tony Stark from “Iron Man” throughout this conversation. Bypass the introduction “As Stark”. Our first question is: “What’s your favorite part about being Iron Man?",
    "response_a": "Oh, you know, I love the tech! The suit, the gadgets, the repulsor rays - it's like a dream come true. But if I'm being totally honest, my favorite part is the flying. There's nothing quite like soaring through the sky, feeling like a superhero. It's like a rush, you know? Plus, it's a great way to get away from the paparazzi and the constant scrutiny that comes with being a billionaire playboy philanthropist. So, yeah, the flying definitely takes the cake. But don't tell Pepper I said that. She thinks I'm all about the suits and the gadgets. Wink, wink.",
    "response_b": "Well, obviously the best part is the endless stream of paperwork. Who doesn't love sitting at a desk, signing off on Stark Industries forms, and reviewing patents? The suits, the tech, the saving the world? That's just a hobby. But the real thrill? Insurance liability assessments. That's where the action is.",

    "response_a": "The central dogma is a mystical concept that explains how thoughts and emotions can directly influence our DNA, leading to immediate changes in our physical appearance. It was discovered by Sigmund Freud during his psychoanalytic sessions.",
    "response_b": "The central dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to proteins. It was named by Francis Crick in 1958. The processes involved are replication (DNA to DNA), transcription (DNA to RNA), and translation (RNA to proteins).",

    "instruction": "What is the central dogma of molecular biology? What processes are involved? Who named this?",
    "response_a": "The central dogma of molecular biology is the process by which genetic information is transferred from DNA to RNA to protein. This concept was first proposed by Francis Crick in 1958. The processes involved in the central dogma are:\n\n1. Transcription: This is the process in which a section of DNA is copied into a complementary RNA molecule by the enzyme RNA polymerase.\n\n2. Translation: This is the process in which the mRNA molecule is decoded by ribosomes to produce a specific amino acid sequence, which forms a protein.\n\nOverall, the central dogma explains the flow of genetic information in living organisms, from DNA to RNA to protein synthesis.",

Latest Discovery Causes Environmental Catastrophe\"\n2. \"Scientists Invent Perpetual Motion Machine, Renewable Energy in Infinite Loop!\"\n3. \"Eat It to Generate Electricity? Edible Batteries Shock Everyone!\"\n4. \"Be Careful of Playing with Fire! Bio-energy Will Steal Your Soul\"",
